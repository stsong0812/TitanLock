Centralized password manager with greater capabilities.

Group Members: Steven Song, Alexandru Gonzales, Davil Gizean

Title: Titan Lock (Centralized Password Management App)

Primary Language: Python

Libraries (some coming soon): Tkinter, Hashlib, random, string, fernet, bcrypt

Summary: We want to create a centralized password manager that not only stores passwords, but generates, tests, and hashes/salts them (with other possible capabilities). We plan to create a simple and easy to use GUI that can be used by anyone. More specifically, we plan to implement a master key to access the app, a tab where passwords are stored, a tab where passwords are generated, a tab to test password strength, and a tab for any additional settings. The passwords will most likely be hashed, salted, and stored in a secure database. Password generation will make use of randomization with parameters that can change its length and complexity. Password strength checking will be carried out by a function that determines strength by examining the password length and complexity. If time allows, we would also like to implement a website to present the app, multi factor authentication, and an increased possibility for customization.
